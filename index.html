          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>
            Before I discovered coding, I was a doctor in the field of
            Anaesthesia, working in the UK. I started learning to code so that I
            could build an app for my workplace (more on that below). It was a
            challenge learning and building on my own but also quite joyous. I
            couldn't ignore this newfound interest and so enrolled myself in
            <a

              >Le Wagon's Web Dev Bootcamp</a
            >
            to develop my skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've had a wonderful career in medicine, where I've learned to work
            in teams to solve complex problems, keep calm under pressure, and
            how to be a kind human. But in this short life I'd like to keep
            learning and evolving, and so I'm pursuing this new path in
            development - a unique combination of creativity and logic that I
            love.

              <h3>Why This Project?</h3>
              <p>
                Music is one of the things I enjoy the most. I wanted finer
                control over my Spotify library without the pain of having to
                manually create one, so I pitched this idea as the final
                project. I feel music is deeply personal - what we listen to
                depends so much on our mood or the occasion; yet music also has
                this great power to bring people together. SoundState is unique
                in that it integrates the OpenAI API to generate an image based
                on the mood/songs of each playlist, in order to make sharing and
                discovering music more visual and fun.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also felt it would be a great learning opportunity -
                integrating the Spotify and OpenAI APIs, becoming more
                proficient at reading documentation, and developing my front-end
                skills.

                I was team lead for this project and got to hone management as
                well as technical skills. Building the app was a huge learning
                experience. Some of the highlights:

                  when we realised some API limitations. For example, using
                  embedded iframes instead of web SDK.

              <p>
                I was returning to work as a doctor in children's anaesthesia, a
                sleep-deprived first-time mum worried about making a drug
                calculation error. I decided to build this app to automate
                calculations (instead of relying on mental arithmetic), and to
                allow quick referencing of care guidelines. This was also aimed
                at improving the onboarding process of anaesthetic registrars
                rotating departments every 3 months.
              </p>
              <p>
                On a personal level, this project is close to my heart because
                it is what sparked my interest in coding. The cherry on top was
                when the app got adopted at work! I experienced first hand what
                a great skill this is to have.

                As I was learning on my own, one of by biggest challenges was
                knowing what best practice is and how to structure my code. I
                switched from watching YouTube videos to Colt Steele's Udemy

                  good on mobile devices to be used on the go)

                Ch-Eye-Nese is a fun audiovisual guide to help eye doctors
                communicate with their patients in Chinese. It translates the
                most common phrases used in an ophthalmology clinic.

              <h3>Why This Project?</h3>
              <p>
                I built this for foreign doctors working in Singapore (my home
                country) who might find it difficult to converse with elderly
                Chinese patients in clinic. Clicking on each image in mobile /
                hovering on desktop overlays the phonetic pronunciation of each
                phrase and plays an audio clip as well.
              </p>
              <h3>Learning Points</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>CSS grid and overlays</li>
                <li>
                  Using the audio tag in HTML and playing audio files with JS
                </li>
