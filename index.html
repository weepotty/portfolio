          <h1>A Wee Bit About Me</h1>
          <p>
            I started learning to code after I had my first child. It was due to
            a mixture of things - the pandemic, feeling isolated with a newborn,
            wanting to keep my brain active and pick up a new skill. I dabbled a
            bit in python, but the realities of looking after a small child
            caught up with me and I had to put it on pause for a while.
          </p>
          <p>
            After my maternity leave, I returned to work as a doctor in
            children's anaesthesia, and was worried about making a drug
            calculation error (sleep deprivation is not good for mental
            arithmetic). There's no margin for error, especially with tiny
            humans! I wanted a way to automate these calculations. I couldn't
            find what I needed, so I decided it was time to give coding another
            go. I used a variety of resources to learn and built the app I was
            looking for. You'll see it below. It was a challenge but I loved it.
            I shared it with my boss and colleagues and they now use it in the
            department. I feel extra fulfilled knowing that the app benefits
            others. It sparked something in me that I couldn't ignore, and so I
            enrolled myself in Le Wagon's Web Dev bootcamp to develop my skills.

            I've had a wonderful career in medicine, where I've learned to work
            in teams to solve complex problems, keep calm under pressure, and
            how to be a kind human. But in this short life I'd like to keep
            learning and evolving, and so I'm pursuing this new path - a unique
            combination of creativity and logic that I love.
