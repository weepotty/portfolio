          <p>
            Before I discovered coding, I was a doctor in the field of
            Anaesthesia, working in the UK. I started learning to code so that I
            could build an app for my workplace (more on that below). It was a
            challenge learning and building on my own but also quite joyous. I
            couldn't ignore this newfound interest and so enrolled myself in

            to develop my skills.

          <p>
            I've had a wonderful career in medicine, where I've learned to work
            in teams to solve complex problems, keep calm under pressure, and
            how to be a kind human. But in this short life I'd like to keep
            learning and evolving, and so I'm pursuing this new path in
            development - a unique combination of creativity and logic that I
            love.
